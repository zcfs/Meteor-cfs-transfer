~~Looking for maintainers - please reach out!~~
This package is to be archived due to inability to find contributors, thanks to everyone who helped make it possible.

**If you're looking for an alternative, we highly recommend [Meteor-Files](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files) by [VeliovGroup](https://github.com/VeliovGroup)**

TODO refactor this package as an abstraction of upload chunk handling that
both http and ddp uploads and any other upload packages can use
